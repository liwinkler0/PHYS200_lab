*Your job is to determine what force will counterbalance the following
three forces (units are Newtons, or N):*

![](media/image1.png){width="1.9076388888888889in"
height="1.9076388888888889in"}*300 N at 0 degrees*

*200 N at 130 degrees*

*500 N at 210 degrees *

Calculate below the components of each of the three vectors.

Calculate the vector addition of the three vectors:

Determine the counterbalance force (the force added to the three to sum
up to zero), both in components, and magnitude-direction:
