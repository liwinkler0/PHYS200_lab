***Statement of the problem***

![](media/image1.png){width="1.9076388888888889in"
height="1.9076388888888889in"}*Your job is to determine what force will
counterbalance the following three forces:*

*300 N at 0 degrees*

*200 N at 130 degrees*

*500 N at 210 degrees *

**Method 1: **

-   Place the three forces and your solution force on the force table
    provided.

-   See how valid your solution is, by changing the angles and weights
    slightly. How much do these need to change to make the ring fall
    off-center?

**Method 2:**

-   Start with the VPython script add\_vectors available on glowscript
    (link on D2L).

-   Run the code and debug it so that the counterbalance force is both
    calculated and visualized. The two forces in this version are NOT
    ones in the problem you are solving!

-   Modify the script to find the counterbalance force of the 3 forces
    in the lab problem, both numerically and graphically.

-   Compare the VPython counterbalance solution to the Method 1
    solution. Note also how the two methods give very different
    visualizations of the counterbalance force...same force, different
    interpretations.

-   By comparison, state whether the two solutions are in agreement. To
    do so, you need to know how accurate the force table solution is.
    Try changing the weights on the string and the angle of the
    solution, and see how far off these can be for the ring to stay
    balanced! This test will give you a range of values for magnitude
    and angle in your solution.

**Turn into Lab1 assignment area: A WORD document that includes: **

-   **Evaluation of the accuracy of the force table solution**

-   **A clear statement about whether the two methods agree, and
    evidence.**

-   **The link to your graphical addition glowscript program**

-   **Short paragraph stating obstacles to completing the lab.**
