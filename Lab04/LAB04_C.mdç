> You are writing VPython code to model the flight of a rocket with a
> known engine impulse class. You will include in the model both the
> thrust curve for the rocket as well as air resistance and gravity. So
> that you add the correct forces together to determine the net force,
> you first show force diagrams on the rocket:
>
> A. Show a diagram including each force acting on the rocket while it
> is burning the fuel in its motor.
>
> B. Show a diagram including each force on the rocket while it is
> moving upwards, but the engine has
>
> burned out.
>
> C. Show a diagram including each force on the rocket when it has
> reached its highest point.
>
> D. Show a diagram including each force on the rocket while it is
> returning to ground in its flight.
