# LAB 4 Modeling the Motion of a Rocket 2: Realistic model
## A-level ideas

Remember:

-   You may do an A-level with anyone you want.
-   The due date for an A-level is the same as the due date for the B-level.
-   You only need to do one idea, and it does not have to come from this
    document! Your instructor may help you come up with even more fun!

Here are some ideas:

1.  Compare the predictions of your VPython code to simulations you find
    online of rocket flights. For example, NASA makes freely available a
    code called "RocketModeller". There is also educational code called
    Winroc that is freeware.
2.  Many rockets eject a parachute at the top of the trajectory. To
    model this in your code, you will need to change the coefficient of
    friction at the top of the trajectory. See if you can model a
    parachute and interpret the results.
3.  Map out how one of the flight parameters (max height, time in the
    air, etc.) changes with the mass of the rocket.
4.  Map out how one of the flight parameters (max height, time in air,
    etc.) changes with the cross-sectional area of the rocket.
5.  Perform an experiment to examine how air drag at low speeds work.
    Dropping coffee filters with different mass and using a motion
    sensor is a good experiment to do.
