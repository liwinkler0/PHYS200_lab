You are writing VPython code to model the flight of a rocket with a
known engine impulse class. You will include in the model all of the
relevant forces, including air drag. To ensure you are including all of
the relevant forces, answer the questions below.

In each one you are asked to draw a diagram clearly showing which
direction the relevant forces point and their relative strengths (i.e.
if two forces are equal their lengths should be the same).

1.  While the rocket is on the ground, before the rocket engines start,
    what force(s) act on the rocket? Draw a diagram showing the
    directions and relative size of those forces.

2.  After the engines have started and the rocket has left the ground
    but before the engines turn off, what force(s) act on the rocket?
    Draw a diagram showing the directions and relative size of those
    forces.

3.  After the engines have turned off and the rocket is still moving
    upwards, what force(s) act on the rocket? Draw a diagram showing the
    directions and relative size of those forces.

4.  At the rocket's highest point, what force(s) act on the rocket? Draw
    a diagram showing the directions and relative size of those forces.

5.  While the rocket is moving back down towards the ground but before
    it hits the ground, what force(s) act on the rocket? Draw a diagram
    showing the directions and relative size of those forces.

6.  Write down an expression for the net force on the rocket that includes
    all of the forces you identified in the previous questions. Some of these
    forces may be zero for parts of the motion but your expression should
    include them all.

7.  The equation for the drag force is in the B-level part of the lab (and below for your convenience). Your rocket will be a cylinder roughly 1cm in diameter, and for the rocket the drag coefficient will be roughly $C=0.75$. What values would be reasonable to use for $A$ and for $\rho$? Explain.

**EQUATION FOR DRAG FORCE:**

$${\overrightarrow{F}}_{D} = - \frac{\text{CA}\rho}{2}\left| \overrightarrow{v} \right|^{2}\widehat{v}$$

where C is a dimensionless number called the "coefficient of drag", A is
the cross-sectional area of the object in flight, $\rho$ is the density of
the fluid (here air) through which the object moves and $\vec{v}$ is the
velocity vector of the object.
