# Lab 07: Modeling spring motion and spring energy

## A-level Ideas

1. Make a new plot when the model is run, that displays a plot of
momentum .y versus ball.pos.y. Explain the graph that you see
mathematically. Specifically, investigate the "parametric equation of an
ellipse" . Also relate what you observe to the concept of "phase space"
and a phase space map.
1. Determine how you could get a spring to move in 2 dimensions. Realize
that the s parameter refers to the total distance the spring has
stretched from its equilibrium position, and that the spring force acts
along a unit vector that points along the spring. Revise your code to
model a 2D spring and describe what you observe.
1. Build into your code a drag force on the mass that is proportional to
the velocity (but opposite the motion) of the oscillating mass. Examine
what happens when the drag is large versus when the drag is small. Here
plotting the position.y of the ball as a function of time will be
useful.
1. Use one of the springs from Lab 6 to acquire data (or re-use data
from Lab 6). Calculate the potential, kinetic, and total energies of the
mass using LoggerPro. Discuss your graphs in light of the Energy
Principle.
