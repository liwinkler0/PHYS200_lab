# Lab 10: Rotational motion

## A-level Ideas

1. Compare the period predicted by the formula $T= 2\pi \sqrt{\ell}{g}$ to the
period form the simulation when the starting angle is large. Also compare the
maximum angular velocity to the formula you derived in the C level. Explain
why one works when the starting angle is large and one does not.
2. Include the mass of the rod in your analysis. You will need to read the
part of the book (Chapter 11) on the physical pendulum to do see the formula
for the period in this case, and modify the code to include the moment of
inertia of the rod. 3. Propose something else!
