# LAB 3 Modeling the Motion of a Rocket 1: Gravity only
## B-level activities

### Objectives

+ Learn about using loops in a VPython program to continue through
time
+ Learn about graphing using VPython
+ Implement the Momentum Principle and Position update to simulate
  motion in VPython

**Rocket code instructions**

-   Debug the code in the "rocket1.py" provided and get it to run.
-   Incorporate the momentum update and position update in the space
    pointed to by the comment lines.
-   Display graphs of y-position versus time and momentum-y versus
    time by uncommenting the statements indicated in the code.
-   Revise the input parameters so that the:
    +   graphs are smooth and
    +   highest point is apparent on the y-position graph
    +   simulation ends when the rocket returns to the ground.
-   Check the numerical solution to finding the highest position.
-   Determine how the solution changes when the mass of the rocket
    increases by a factor of 10.
-   Come up with a "limiting case" that you could use to check your code, and then check that case.
-   Create a Word document to submit to the Lab3\_B assignment area.
    This document should include (at minimum):
    -   Names of contributing partners
    -   A link to your working glowscript animation (Public link)
    -   Screenshots of the position/momentum graphs, with an indication
        on each of the highest point in the rocket path.
    -   A description of how you knew the program was working correctly,
        including
        - comparing rocket behavior to your C-level calculations.
        - describing one limiting case, the expected result in that case, and what your code did.
