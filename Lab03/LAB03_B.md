**Basic B-level rocket code**

-   Debug the code in the "rocket1.py" provided and get it to run.

-   Incorporate the momentum update and position update in the space
    pointed to by the comment lines.

-   Incorporate graphs of y-position versus time and momentum-y versus
    time in the "rocket1.py" code to display how position and momentum
    change with time. (Uncomment the appropriate statements indicated.)

-   Revise the input parameters so that: the graphs are smooth and the
    highest point is apparent on the y-position graph.

-   Check the numerical solution to finding the highest position.

-   Determine how the solution changes when the mass of the rocket
    increases by a factor of 10.

-   Create a Word document to submit to the Lab3\_B assignment area.
    This document should include (at minimum):

    -   Names of contributing partners

    -   A link to your working glowscript animation (Public link)

    -   Screenshots of the position/momentum graphs, with an indication
        on each of the highest point in the rocket path.

    -   A description of how you knew the program was working correctly
        (compare rocket behavior to your C-level calculations).
