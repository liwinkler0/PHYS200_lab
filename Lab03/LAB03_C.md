> You are working on VPython code to animate a rocket launched straight
> up. It has a mass of 0.200 kg,
>
> and is launched in the code with an initial velocity of 50 m/s.
>
> 1\. Use the momentum principle to estimate the expected time of flight
> for the rocket, with no air
>
> resistance in the animation. *Show your work. This can be a way to
> check your code calculations. *
>
> 2\. If there is no air resistance, explain why the mass of the rocket
> does not matter in the
>
> determination of the time of flight.
