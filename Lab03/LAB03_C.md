# LAB 3 Modeling the Motion of a Rocket 1: Gravity only
## C-level Group Questions

Group Names:

You are working on VPython code to animate a rocket launched straight
up. It has a mass of 0.200 kg,

and is launched in the code with an initial velocity of 50 m/s.

1. Use the momentum principle to calculate the time of flight
of the rocket (the amount of time the rocket is in the air), with no air resistance in the animation. **Show your work.** *You will use this to check your code calculations.*

2. Explain why the mass of the rocket does not matter in the determination of the time of flight if there is no air resistance.

3. What is the maximum height the rocket will reach? *Hint*: What is the velocity of the rocket at its highest point?
