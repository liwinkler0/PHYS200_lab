# LAB 3 Modeling the Motion of a Rocket 1: Gravity only
## Lab 3 A-level Ideas

Remember:

-   You may do an A-level with anyone you want.
-   The due date for an A-level is the same as the B level.
-   You only need to do one idea, and it does not have to come from this
    document! Your instructor may help you come up with even more fun!

Here are some ideas:

1.  Aim the rocket at an angle, and verify that its range and maximum
    height are as predicted.
2.  Give the rocket enough initial velocity so that it gets a
    substantial distance above/away from the Earth. Use the vector form
    of gravity to determine the net force on the rocket as its "r" from
    the center of the Earth gets larger and larger.
3.  Investigate air drag, and implement air drag in the code to see how
    the rocket trajectory is affected (this is looking ahead a little).
4.  Instead of giving the rocket an initial velocity, try to make a
    large upward force act on it for a short time interval (this is
    looking ahead a little).
