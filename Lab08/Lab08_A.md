# Lab 07: Modeling spring motion and spring energy

## A-level Ideas

1. Redo the B-level experiment but make it better. This might include, for example, more carefully zeroing the position sensor and measuring the spring constant of your springs from the data you collect.
1. Analyze energy conservation for a cart on an inclined ramp with no spring.
2. Analyze energy conservation for a cart on an inclined ramp attached to a spring.
3. Write a vpython simulation of the cart-on-a-spring system from the B-level and use the simulation to understand possible sources of error in your B-level experiment.
