# Lab 09: Hackathon

## C-level Group Questions


### Part 1 of 2: Find another person to work with

You should find **one** other person at or near your level to work with on
this project.

### Part 2 of 2: Pick a problem

You can choose to do any **one** of these problems; all are around the same
level of difficulty, so pick the one that seems most interesting to you.

1. Chapter 6, Problem 77: Gravitational force and orbits. Start with your lab
3 code, modified to use the more general form of the gravitational force
instead of the formula valid near the Earth's surface.
1. Chapter 7, Problem 45: A spring with air resistance. Start with your Lab 6 code.
2. Chapter 7, Problem 47: Motion of a ball with air resistance. Start with
your Lab 4 rocket code (remove the rocket engine force from F_net of course)
3. Chapter 7, Problem 50: Resonance of mass on spring. *Warning*: this one is
interesting but pretty long.
4. *Propose another problem*. This *must* be approved by your lab instructor.

### Part 3: Think about how you will check your code

Answer these questions:

1. Start a list of the changes you will need to make to the code you already
have. Some of the options above mention at least one thing you will need to
change, but there are more. \vspace{1in}
2. What are *detailed* ways you can check that the code is running correctly?
For Lab 7, a *bad* example would be "if the mass oscillates up and down the
code is working." Also for that lab, good examples would be things like "total
energy will be conserved" or "the position of the mass will be calculated
using Eq. X from the book and compared to the code output." \vspace{2in}

### Part 4: Grading

This lab will be graded on three things:

1. Correctness and details of your answers to the question you choose,
*especially the way(s) you are checking that your code is correct.*
2. Appearance of the simulation. More points if your Earth looks like the
Earth, your baseball is a baseball, etc. A nice example of this from a couple
years ago is (the topic that year was collisions):
