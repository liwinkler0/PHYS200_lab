**LAB 5: A-level Ideas**

Remember:

-   You may do an A-level with anyone you want.
-   The due date for an A-level is the same as the B-level.
-   You only need to do one idea, and it does not have to come from this
    document! Your instructor may help you come up with even more fun!

Here are some ideas:

-   We have collected a couple videos showing just the first second or
    so of the launch. LoggerPro has video analysis built into it. Learn
    how to analyze a video, then use this skill to attempt to extract
    the thrust curve for the engine from the launch data. Compare
    your thrust curve to the one provided with the Lab 4 module.
-   Model some small effects into your code and compare to flight
    results. Here are some small effects (supposedly): the mass of the
    rocket becomes smaller as fuel is burned during the launch; the fins
    actually contribute a small amount to the air drag area; the nose
    cone shape affects the air drag constant.
-   Coffee filters are often used in labs to demonstrate the action of
    air drag. There are a number of interesting experiments you can
    perform with coffee filters and your ultrasonic motion detector.
    (Coffee filters are always available in our department.) Consider:
    measuring the terminal velocity of the filter as a function of its
    mass, for example.
-   In addition to experiments with coffee filters, you can revise your
    VPython rocket code to simulate a coffee filter dropping downward
    with air friction and gravity. The air drag may either be
    proportional to velocity or to velocity$^2$. Calculate a prediction
    for a filter, then measure it and see which form of air drag seems
    to work best with a coffee filter.
