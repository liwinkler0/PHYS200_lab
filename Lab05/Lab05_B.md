# LAB 5 Make, launch and test model rocket
## B-level

**NOTE: This Lab is a continuation of Lab 4. You are going to perform an
experiment as a team with another lab group. Your group should be 4 or 5
people. You will construct, test, launch, and analyze two or three model
rockets.**

As a team, you will decide on a controlled experiment to conduct with
your rockets. Below are some **suggested experiments**.

-   Get two different engine types, and see how the flights agree with
    predicted flights for each engine.
-   Make rockets with a different mass for each. Determine how mass
    affects the time of flight.
-   Try a rocket with three fins versus one with 4 or more fins. Does
    number of fins affect the time of flight?
-   Construct identical rockets, and use the flight times to determine
    the drag coefficient for this shape.

## I. Construction of Rockets (This is the C-level portion worth 50
points)

Get together with the lab group next to yours in the physics lab.

-   Decide what one SINGLE variable you will change.
-   Obtain Estes engines from your instructor consistent with your
    experimental goals.
-   Obtain rocket body tubes from instructor, consistent with your
    goals.
-   Construct the rockets so that they can test a single variable using
    the flight time as observable. You will also need to choose a shape,
    size, and number of fins to cut out and secure to the base of the
    body tube.
-   You may make the probes have different mass by loading the nosecones
    with different amounts of clay.

Specifications for the construction are:

-   The engines are securely mounted (glued in place).
-   Students have constructed rockets with control of variables in mind.
-   The two parameters that go into the force of drag equation, area and
    mass, are as carefully measured as possible.
-   Shapes of fin and nose-cone structures are carefully recorded.
-   **The rockets are tested for stability prior to launch date.**
-   Rockets must have a straw glued to the side to attach to the launcher.
-   The paired groups can have up to 3 atmospheric probes to launch
    total. Realize there are no extra engines in case of a mistake.

Approved materials that will be provided for construction: glue-sticks,
elmer's/wood glue, hot glue/glue guns; colored construction paper; tin
foil; corrugated cardboard; putty/clay, straws (needed for the launch
rail), duct tape, masking tape, scotch tape.

Other approved materials include (but are not provided): superglue,
balsa wood, soft plastics, craft paint, decorative elements like glitter
and stickers.

Materials that specifically must be avoided: sharp metals, metal pieces,
explosives other than the engine.

## II. Testing the probes for Stability

You must conduct a swing test to ensure safety prior to launch.

## III. Launching the Probes

-   We launch during a lab period, either Oct. 9 or Oct. 11 depending on
    weather and readiness.
-   The launch area is one of the fields over by the Nemzek field house,
    behind the track/football field.
-   All personnel in your group are needed at launch.

## IV. Data Analysis

Analyze each flight using the VPython code written in Lab 4:

-   **If C is unknown, change C in the code so simulation reproduces
    flight time.**
-   **If another parameter was changed such as mass, assume C=1 and see
    if launch flight times are closely simulated in the code.**

## V. Submit a Final Report of Your Results

Each person should submit their own report, though it is fine if each of
the lab reports for members of your group are identical:

-   A diagram giving information on your rocket design
-   All design parameters for each rocket, including mass and area
-   Time of flight for each probe that had a successful flight
-   Code predictions for the time of flight, or for the coefficient of
    air drag (depending on your experimental design)
-   Conclusion
-   A list of participants and a brief description of their
    contributions. Contributions should include, VPython programming,
    building the rockets, launch day roles, running VPython analysis,
    etc.
