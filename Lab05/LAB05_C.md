# LAB 5 Make, launch and test model rocket
## C-level Group Activities


Group Names: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

For the C-level, you are expected to:

1. Build the rockets for your group. Use materials available in the
labs or similar. Please do not take glue guns home, but you can take
tubes for your rocket, fin cardboard, and paper.
3. Here are some construction errors to
avoid: [Rocket\_error](/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=4317308&type=content&rcode=MNSCU_LOCA-20605858)
4. Be sure to watch the video "How to Make a Rocket Stable": [https://youtu.be/AhS5fT_EE6M](https://youtu.be/AhS5fT_EE6M)
5. Perform the safety/swing test on all your rockets. If they are
unstable, remove the nose cone and try adding a larger clay blob into
the nose cone. Make sure the cone is securely closed.
6. Come to the intramural field on 6th avenue just past the Scheel's
football stadium on Tuesday Oct. 4 at your lab time. Launch pads will
be set up both on Tuesday and Thursday (Thursday as needed).
7. Have a blast--you will ignite your own engines. We also need
volunteers to record flight time data.
