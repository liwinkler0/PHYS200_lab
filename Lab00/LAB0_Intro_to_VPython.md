# LAB 0: Introduction to 3D Computer Modeling

## OBJECTIVES

### In this *course* you will construct computer models to:

+ Visualize motion in 3D using a programming environment called
VPython, which is the widely-used Python programming language
(python.org) plus a 3D graphics module, vpython
+ Visualize vector quantities like position, momentum, and force in
3D
+ Do calculations based on fundamental principles to predict the
motion of interacting objects
+Animate the predicted motions in 3D

### In this *lab* you will learn:

+ How to use glowscript, the cloud-based interactive editor for
VPython
+ How to structure a simple computer program
+ How to create 3D objects such as spheres and arrows
+ How to use vectors in VPython

### OVERVIEW OF A COMPUTER PROGRAM

+ A computer program consists of a sequence of instructions.
+ The computer carries out the instructions one by one, in the order
in which they appear, and stops when it reaches the end.
+ Each instruction must be entered exactly correctly (as if it were
an instruction to your calculator).
+ If the computer encounters an error in an instruction (such as a
typing error), it will stop running and print a red error message.

## Main Activities

1.  Get familiar with glowscript (see Intro to Glowscript video link in
    D2L: Lab0 module):
    + Create a Google account
    + Sign into glowscript with your Google account
    + Try running the Starting Program, with link in D2L: Lab0 module
    + Create a public and private folder in your glowscript account
    + Copy the Starting Program lines into a program you create into your
      public folder
    + Try editing the Starting Program and see what the various lines of
      code do
2.  Learn about VPython using the following tutorials:
    + [VPython Instructional Videos: 1. 3D Objects](https://youtu.be/KbOyKOlWBrs)
    + [VPython Instructional Videos: A. Debugging Syntax Errors](https://youtu.be/kqFdB0lbGa8)
    + [VPython Instructional Videos: 2. Variable Assignment](https://youtu.be/jLHS0ZvYE5Y)
3.  Be sure to create the challenge programs each one asks for.
4.  On your local computer, open a Word document. Write the names of all
    people you worked with. Then tell us any challenges or obstacles you
    ran into in the lab this week. Then be sure to paste the **PUBLIC**
    glowscript link to your solution to the **final challenge program
    posed in Video 2. Variable assignment.** (This challenge has you
    create three spheres connected by arrows.)
5.  Submit your Word document on D2L under the Lab0 Assignment
    (Assignments are under Assessments).
