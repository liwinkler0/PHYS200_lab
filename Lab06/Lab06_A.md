# Lab 06: Spring motion and spring constants

## A-level Ideas

Realize that some of these may require extra thought/research. Also realize
you are free to develop your own idea.

*The best A-level work shows: quantitative measurements; a fit to the
data with uncertainty; relating the fit to a physical quantity and
describing how the measurement compares to expected results.*

+ How does the *period* of oscillation of the spring-mass system depend
on the *amplitude* of the oscillations?
+ Determine the spring stiffness constant for two springs in series or
in parallel.
+ Try to determine experimentally how much of the mass of the spring
contributes to the oscillation. You will need to measure how the period
changes when different masses are set into oscillation.
+ Determine the Young's modulus of a marshmallow.
+ Plot Force versus velocity for one of your oscillations, or position
versus velocity. Describe why the graph appears as it does.
+ Use the tangent tool in LoggerPro to measure the derivative of the
position versus time curve for an oscillation. Compare the tangent tool
results to the appropriate derivative curve.
+ Use a note card or large piece of paper to dampen the oscillations of
the mass on the spring. Fit the resulting oscillation curve to measure
the damping constant of air acting on the system.
