# Lab 06: Spring motion and spring constants
## B-level experiments

### Objectives

-   Investigate the properties of a spring-mass system
-   Explore what factors influence the oscillation of a spring-mass
    system
-   Gain experience with spring-like forces that are proportional to the
    amount of stretch of a spring or wire

### Equipment

-   Vernier force sensor
-   Vernier motion sensor
-   Colored helical spring (note that the spring stiffness constants
    of these are marked on the box)
-   Mass set
-   LoggerPro software

## Measure spring constant:

-   Suspend a force probe and helical spring vertically from a ring
    support stand.
-   Use a mass that stretches the spring by a few cm under its weight,
    but not too much stretch.
-   Use a motion sensor underneath the mass to track the oscillating
    motion.
-   Displace the hanging mass *by a cm or so* (not too much) and record
    the oscillating force, position, and velocity of the mass over a
    few cycles.
-   Use LoggerPro to graph force versus position. Fit the data to an
    appropriate fit, and determine the spring constant from the fit. **Do
    not forget to right click the fit parameters box, and choose the
    option to "Show uncertainties".**
-   Be sure to compare the measured spring constant to its marked value.

**Predict period of motion**

-   Use the measured spring constant and hanging mass to predict the
    period of the oscillating motion.

-   Use the force, position, and velocity graphs versus time. Fit at
    least one to the oscillating function discussed by your instructor
    (C-level activity) by using the appropriate fit function in
    LoggerPro.

-   Be sure to compare the predicted period to the measured period.

## What to include in your lab report:

-   Names of all lab partners
-   Force versus position graph, snipped from LoggerPro into your
    document.
-   The spring constant, including uncertainty and units, that you
    measured from that graph.
-   Comparison of measured and given stiffness constants and whether they are consistent. They are considered consistent if the difference is less than three times the uncertainty in your spring constant
-   One of your sinusoidal graphs from LoggerPro, showing the sinusoidal
    fit parameters with uncertainty.
-   Comparison of period from your prediction and from the fit of the
    oscillating function.
-   A description of each of the 4 parameters in the sinusoidal fit: what does each represent?
