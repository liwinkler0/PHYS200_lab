# LAB2 A Ideas

![](./Expt_setup.png){height="1.5in"}

Do the experiment from the B-level, question 2a, that you did *not* do for the B-level.

-   How do position, velocity and momentum change in time when you have
    a constant cart mass being pulled by a variable pulley weight? (Do a
    separate trial for each different mass you place on the pulley.)

**Note**: You need to quantify the relationships with a GRAPH from
LoggerPro. Quantifying the relationship means you fit the data points to
a mathematical function, such as a straight line, parabola, etc. Then
extract a useful number from that fit, such as a slope from a linear
fit. Always include the uncertainty on the fit, or the +/-. The
uncertainty indicates the quality of your data.
