+ Find correlations between different variables using graphing methods
+ Become more familiar with the Momentum Principle

## Equipment:

- Motion sensor
- Mounting bracket for motion sensor
- Force probe
- Mounting rod to attach force probe to cart
- Cart and track
- Pulley with string
- Hanging mass set

**Set-up (helpful video is available under the Lab 2 module in D2L):**

- Measure the mass of the cart and the mass of the force probe
  (balance available in corner of room).
- Set up the track, motion detector, cart and force probe as shown in
  the video.
- Check the force sensor setting. The force sensor has two settings on
  it. Be sure you are using the correct one in your experiment. The force
  applied by the hanging mass is approximately $F_{hang} = m_{hang} g$, where
  g=9.8 m/s$^2$.
- Practice taking data a couple times before starting the experiments.
- Equipment/software notes are included in this module if you need
  further detail.

## B-level experiments

1.  Basic measurements and test of your vpython model.
    a.  Take one run of data to measure the force applied to the cart
        and the final velocity of the cart. Note: your initial and final
        points might not be the beginning/end of your graph. Focus just
        on the part of the motion when the cart if being pulled by a
        constant force.
    b.  Get the vpython code from the D2L link, and edit it so the
        applied force and mass of the cart/probe match your experiment,
        and the start and ending time for the motion match your experiment.
    c.  Compare the velocity calculated from vpython with the velocity
        you measured.
2.  Answering the C-level question.
    a.  Which ONE of the experiments lets you address the
        question Liz and Peter were discussing?
        i.  How do velocity, and momentum change when you have a
            constant weight pulling a variable cart mass if you apply
            the force for the same amount of time?
        i. How do velocity and momentum change when you have a constant
            cart mass being pulled by a variable pulley weight?
    a.  Carry out the experiment. You will need to
        i. Do a run for at least 5 different masses.
        i. Instead of trying to take data for exactly the same amount
            of time in each case, record the rate of change (slope) of
            the velocity.
        i.  Make graphs in logger pro of the
            1.  rate of change of velocity as a function of mass
            2.  rate of change of momentum as a function of mass.
        i. Fit the theoretical relationship  between rate of change of *momentum*
           of the cart and the mass of the cart to your data.
        i. Fit the theoretical relationship  between rate of change of *velocity*
           of the cart and the mass of the cart to your data.

**What to include in your write-up:**

-   Compare the final velocity in your first run to the result from the
    vpython program.
-   Include at least one example of graphs showing force, velocity and
    position as a function of time. It is ok if that graphs has runs for
    several different masses.
-   Include graphs showing how momentum change and velocity change
    depend on mass.
    *Note: You need to quantify the relationships with a GRAPH from
    LoggerPro. Quantifying the relationship means you fit the data
    points to a mathematical function, such as a straight line,
    parabola, etc. Then extract a useful number from that fit, such as a
    slope from a linear fit. Always include the uncertainty on the fit.*
-   Use those graphs to explain whether Liz or Peter is correct.
