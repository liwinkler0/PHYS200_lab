**Equipment:**

-   Motion sensor

-   Mounting bracket for motion sensor

-   Force probe

-   Mounting rod to mount force probe on cart

-   Cart and track

-   Pulley with string

-   Hanging mass set

**Statement of the problem:** Are force and momentum change directly
proportional to one another? How are force and the mass of the forced
object related?

**Set-up Notes: (Helpful videos are available under the Lab 2 module.)**

-   Use a bracket to securely attach the motion sensor to one end of the
    track.

-   Practice capturing motion with the sensor before attempting any
    experiment.

-   Practice using the LoggerPro software before saving any experiment.

-   The Force sensor has two settings on it. Be sure you are using the
    correct one in your experiment. Recall that Force in Newtons= mass
    in kg \* g (g=9.8 m/s^2^)

-   Again, practice collecting force data with the force probe before
    attempting any experiment.

**Basic B-level experiment. Do one of the two bullet items as your
B-level experiment. The other bullet item will be your A-level Advanced
experiment. **

-   How do position, velocity, and momentum change in time when you have
    a constant weight pulling a variable cart mass? (Do a separate trial
    for each different mass you place on the cart.)

-   How do position, velocity and momentum change in time when you have
    a constant cart mass being pulled by a variable pulley weight? (Do a
    separate trial for each different mass you place on the pulley.)

**Note: You need to quantify the relationships with a GRAPH from
LoggerPro. Quantifying the relationship means you fit the data points to
a mathematical function, such as a straight line, parabola, etc. Then
extract a useful number from that fit, such as a slope from a linear
fit. Always include the uncertainty on the fit, or the +/-. The
uncertainty indicates the quality of your data.**
