You and a group of friends are in a heated debate brought on by a
discussion of loading a friend's truck with too much mass. Peter, in the
group, has been taking physics. Peter argues that the truck does not
need to exert more force to start moving when fully loaded, compared to
empty. He says that force is the same as momentum change over time, and
he says the same force always creates the same momentum change in the
same time. Liz in the group says that can't be right. She has been
taking physics too, and knows that it is harder to get a more massive
object moving than a less massive object moving. So the truck will have
to exert more force to get the fully loaded truck moving.

What would you say to Liz and Peter (if they asked you to step in)?
Before you speak, think. A sketch of several graphs in time may help
resolve the difficulty.

Suppose the truck exerts the same force whether it is fully loaded or
empty. Below show a sketch in each box comparing how you would expect
the quantity to change in time (same time interval) when the truck is
fully loaded compared to empty. Review the Forces in 1D simulation if
you have trouble here.

> Extra: What might position look like?


How could you resolve the argument?
